## Motivation for the Project:  
Route 66 with be 100 years old in 2026.  I was curious what websites were listing for must see sights.  Road Affair caught my eye, as it listed 66 attractions and had sites from all 8 states.  Many other websites would list a handful of locations.  Road Affair could be a site which people would read to see what attractions they should visit while traveling the Historic Route.

## Files in Repository: 
 - Jupyter Notebook: Route 66 Final Code.ipynb 
	- Used to pull data from the dataset
 - Dataset: route66.csv
	- Dataset was pulled from Road Affair website - https://www.roadaffair.com/best-route-66-attractions/

## Summary of Results - My 3 questions were:

### Question 1:  What types of attractions made Road Affairâ€™s list? 
All the attractions are in one of the following catagories: Site, Museum, Restaurant, Store, Motel, Gas Station, Bridge, Park, Water Tower, Art, Theater.  With the majority of attractions being a site or museum or restaurant.

### Question 2: Does every state have a museum on the list?  Yes, all 8 states have at least 1 museum.

## Question 3: What attractions were built in each decade and count ones with no date? The oldest attraction was built in the 1890's, about 30 years before Route 66 became a highway.  It's important to note that 28 out of the 66 attractions did not list a year.  Those needed to be accounted but a year could not implied.  Therefore the number of attractions without a year was just counted and added to the table as no year.
