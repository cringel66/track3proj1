## Libraries in Notebook:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - matplotlib.pyplot
 
## Motivation for the Project:  
Route 66 with be 100 years old in 2026.  I was curious what websites were listing for must see sights.  Road Affair caught my eye, as it listed 66 attractions and had sites from all 8 states.  Many other websites would list a handful of locations.  Road Affair could be a site which people would read to see what attractions they should visit while traveling the Historic Route.

## Files in Repository: 
 - Jupyter Notebook: Route 66 Final Code.ipynb 
	- Used to pull data from the dataset
 - Dataset: route66.csv
	- Dataset was pulled from Road Affair website - https://www.roadaffair.com/best-route-66-attractions/

## Summary of Results:
 - Blog posting for this project can be found at https://cringel66.github.io/track3proj1/
 - The assignment was to use a dataset of my choice, ask 3 intersting questions, using python gather data from the dataset, then visualize the data, and analyse the results. 

My topic was about Route 66 as I spend my vacations traveling what is left of the old historic Route.  I'm always curious what authors or forums think the "best sites" are along the Route.  This Road Affair article caught my eye since it listed 66 attractions instead of the typical handful.  Route 66 will be 100 years old and they heyday of the Route would of been back in the mid 20th century.  So I was curious the type or site, if site were listed for all 8 states, and the age of the attractions.

- My 3 questions were:

### Question 1:  What's the percentage of each type of attraction that made Road Affairâ€™s list? 
All the attractions are in one of the following catagories: Site, Museum, Restaurant, Store, Motel, Gas Station, Bridge, Park, Water Tower, Art, Theater.  With the majority of attractions being a site or museum or restaurant.

### Question 2: Does every state have a museum on the list?  
Yes, all 8 states have at least 1 museum.

### Question 3: How many attractions were built in each decade? 
The oldest attraction was built in the 1890's, about 30 years before Route 66 became a highway.  It's important to note that 28 out of the 66 attractions did not list a year.  Those needed to be accounted but a year could not implied.  Therefore the number of attractions without a year was just counted and added to the table as no year.
