NOTE: This blog was created as a part of a ‘Data Engineering’ course that I’m completing at work.

Route 66 will celebrate 100 years in 2026 and it served a major role in the United States westward migration during the 20th century.  Coined “The Mother Road” in The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, the highway passed through 8 states starting in Chicago Illinois and ending near the Santa Monica Pier in Los Angeles, California.  Although the original Route 66 was decommissioned in 1985, as interstates were built pulling traffic from the Route, there is continued interest worldwide of traveling what is left of the original road. 

I read the article “66 Best Attractions on Route 66 You Must Visit” from Road Affair’s website (https://www.roadaffair.com/best-route-66-attractions/) and wanted to use this data for my course work.  I have spent most of my vacations over the past 12 years traveling the Mother Road.  During my travels, I take the frontage road or the rough dirt road that was once the Route.  I avoid the interstate unless it replaced that section of Route 66.  I stop in the various businesses and talk to the wonderful owners.  All of them love their towns’ and are proud to be part of the original Route 66. 

For my assignment, I was to come up with 3 questions of interest: 


I thought it would be interesting to categorize the attractions by type.  Was there a specific type of attractions that appeared most of the list.

## Question 1:  What's the percentage of each type of attraction that made Road Affair’s list?

It was interesting that the second largest category was museums.  I actually would of expected it to be restaurants or motels since there are so many of those along the Route.  I then wanted to determine the actual percentage of each category.

Museums were at 19.7% of the entire list of 66 attractions.  I found that 13 attractions on the list were museums and Route 66 only went through 8 states.  That then led me to my next question.



## Questions 2: 	Does every state have a museum on the list?  
The number of miles through each state varied greatly with Kansas only having a short 13-mile section.  So of the 13 museums on the list, what states has multiples?

Every state has at least one museum.  Surprisingly, Kansas has 2 museums on the list.  Then it's surprise Illinois only has one listed when it has so many miles through the state and also that Abraham Lincoln was from Springlfield Illinios along Route 66 and there's so many attractions in that area for him.

These museums are a great place to stop to get local information and history.  It makes seeing the 'sites' on the list that more interesting to stop for a picture.



Since Route 66 will be 100 soon and knowing the heyday of the Route started shortly after many Americans were able to buy cars. (mid 1920s), that lead me to my final question.

## Question 3:  How many attractions were built in each decade?

The oldest attraction was built in the 1890's, about 30 years before Route 66 became a highway. It's important to note that 28 out of the 66 attractions did not list a year. Those needed to be accounted but a year could not implied. Therefore the number of attractions without a year was just counted and added to the table as no year.

The most attractions from the list were built from the 20’s through the 40’s.  But it was interesting to see that each decade since the 50’s additional attractions were added even into the 2000s which is 30+ years since route 66 was decommisioned (June 1985). The list below are those attractions built since 1950.

Interesting to note that the last motel from the list was built in 1950.  From the 38 attractions with a year built, 13 of them were built in 1950 or later.  That's over a 1/3 of the attractions.  In those 13 attractions, 7 were sites.  It just shows that people continue to build new attractions to bring people to their business.  Let's keep Route 66 hopin.
